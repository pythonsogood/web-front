			<h2>About Viktor Tsoi</h2>
			<h3>(21 June 1962 – 15 August 1990)</h3>
			<p>Viktor Robertovich Tsoi was a Russian singer-songwriter and actor who co-founded Kino, one of the most popular and influential bands in the history of Russian music.<br>Born and raised in Leningrad (modern-day Saint Petersburg) to a Russian mother and Koryo-saram father, Tsoi started writing songs as a teenager. Throughout his career, Tsoi contributed a plethora of musical and artistic works, including ten albums. After Kino appeared and performed in the 1987 Soviet film Assa, the band's popularity surged, triggering a period referred to as "Kinomania", and leading to Tsoi's leading role in the 1988 Kazakh new wave art film The Needle. In 1990, after their high-profile concert at the Luzhniki Stadium, Tsoi briefly relocated to Latvia with bandmate Yuri Kasparyan to work on the band's next album. Two months after the concert, Tsoi died in a traffic collision.</p>
